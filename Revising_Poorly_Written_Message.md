## Original Message

Hi—  
This new territory is a pain. Lots of stops; no sales. Ughhhh. People out here resistant to change. Could get hit by a boulder and still no change. Giant companies ought to be up on charges. Will sub. reports asap as long as you care rec.  
The long and short of it is that market is down. No news = bad news.

## Revised Professional Email

**Subject:** Update on New Territory Progress  

Dear Dr. Schwartz,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the progress in the new territory. While the market has been challenging and initial sales are slower than expected, I’ve identified several potential leads that may develop into future opportunities. Many of the businesses in this area appear hesitant to transition to new vendors, but I am continuing to focus on building relationships and demonstrating the value of our products.

I will submit my detailed report as soon as possible once all regional data is collected and verified. Please let me know if there are specific areas you’d like me to address in greater detail in my next update.

Thank you for your time and continued support.

Best regards,  
Sharon Kelley

## Explanation of Revision

This revision applies the principles from Kolin (2022), which emphasize professionalism, clarity, and a reader-centered tone in workplace communication. The original message used informal language, negative phrasing, and unclear abbreviations that could be perceived as disrespectful or careless.

The revised version corrects these issues by:

- Using a clear and respectful greeting and closing appropriate for addressing a professor or supervisor.  
- Replacing emotional or slang expressions (such as “pain,” “Ughhhh,” and “up on charges”) with objective, professional language.  
- Adding specific, factual updates to improve clarity and purpose.  
- Demonstrating the “You Attitude” by focusing on progress, accountability, and next steps rather than frustration.

This approach ensures the message reflects strong business communication standards while maintaining a positive and professional tone.
