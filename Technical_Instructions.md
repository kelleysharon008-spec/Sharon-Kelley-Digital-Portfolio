## Part 1 – Step-by-Step Technical Instructions

### How to Connect a Laptop to a Wi-Fi Network

Connecting your laptop to Wi-Fi allows you to access the internet without using a wired cable. Follow the steps below in the exact order listed.

#### Before You Begin

- Make sure your laptop is powered on.  
- Ensure the Wi-Fi network you want to join is active.  
- If your network is password-protected, have the password ready.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1:** Click the Wi-Fi icon located at the bottom-right corner of your screen on the taskbar. If you do not see the icon, click the upward arrow (^) to expand hidden icons.

**Step 2:** Make sure the Wi-Fi toggle switch is set to **On**. If the toggle is gray, click it once to activate Wi-Fi.

**Step 3:** A list of available Wi-Fi networks will appear. Click the name of the network you want to connect to.

**Step 4:** If the network is secured, a password box will appear. Type the Wi-Fi password exactly as provided and click **Connect**.  
*Note:* Wi-Fi passwords are case-sensitive, meaning capital and lowercase letters must match exactly.

**Step 5:** After a few seconds, the network name will show “Connected.” Open a web browser and visit a website such as `https://www.google.com` to confirm your internet connection.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **If no networks appear:** Restart your laptop and move closer to the wireless router.  
- **If the password does not work:** Confirm capitalization, numbers, and symbols, and try again carefully.  
- **If websites will not load even though Wi-Fi shows “Connected”:** Disconnect and reconnect the Wi-Fi, or restart your router.

## Part 3 – Reflection on Revisions and What I Learned

Testing the instructions with another person was extremely helpful. Although the steps seemed clear to me, my friend misunderstood two areas: the location of the Wi-Fi icon and the meaning of “case-sensitive.” Their feedback helped me revise the instructions to include more detailed explanations, a clearer description of icon placement, and a definition of case sensitivity.

This process taught me that technical writing is not about what the writer understands, but what the user understands. User testing is crucial because it exposes assumptions and unclear wording that writers may overlook. Overall, I learned the importance of clarity, consistency, formatting, and anticipating user errors when creating technical instructions.
