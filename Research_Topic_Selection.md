## Top Three Research Topic Choices

### 1. Artificial Intelligence and Job Displacement

This topic interests me because artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming nearly every industry, and its impact on employment is one of the most debated technological challenges of the modern age. I would like to explore how AI automation is reshaping workforce dynamics, the types of jobs most at risk, and strategies individuals and organizations can use to adapt. As AI continues to evolve, examining the skills and career fields that will remain valuable in an AI-driven economy offers strong academic and professional relevance.

### 2. Cybersecurity and Data Breaches

I am also interested in cybersecurity because it is essential to both business and personal data protection in today’s digital environment. This topic would allow me to research the ethical responsibilities companies hold in safeguarding user information, as well as best practices for individuals to protect their data. Data breaches have long-term implications for trust, financial stability, and organizational reputation, making this subject highly relevant to information systems professionals.

### 3. E-waste and Environmental Impact

My third choice is the environmental impact of electronic waste. This topic focuses on the sustainability challenges created by rapid technological advancement and consumer demand for new devices. I am particularly interested in examining how technology manufacturers can adopt eco-friendly production and recycling methods and how consumers can influence companies to reduce environmental harm. This subject aligns with global discussions on responsible technology use and corporate sustainability.

## Conclusion

Each of these topics—AI’s effect on employment, cybersecurity ethics, and electronic waste management—offers a unique perspective on how technology intersects with ethics, sustainability, and human behavior. Regardless of which topic is selected, my research will aim to integrate ethical considerations, technical knowledge, and real-world applications.
