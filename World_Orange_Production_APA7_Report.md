## World Orange Production Analysis (2017–2021)

The table and chart presented in this report summarize world orange production across eight major countries from 2017 to 2021. During this period, Brazil consistently produced the highest volume of oranges and showed strong upward growth across all five years. India also demonstrated steady increases, emerging as another major producer. In contrast, the United States experienced a significant decline in production, particularly in the final two years of the dataset. China showed notable fluctuations, while Mexico and Spain displayed more modest variations year over year.

The rising production levels in Brazil and India suggest growing agricultural capacity and favorable climate conditions, while the declines in the United States may reflect environmental challenges, crop disease, or economic factors. The European Union also showed gradual increases, indicating slow but steady improvement in overall output. The comparative trends across nations highlight the different agricultural, environmental, and economic forces shaping global citrus production during this period.
