1. **Original:** Something is obviously wrong in your head office. They have once more sent me the wrong model number. Can they ever get things straight?

2. **Original:** My instructor wants me to do a term paper on safety regulations at a small plant. Since you are the manager of a small plant, send me all the information I need at once. My grade depends heavily on all this.

   **Revised:** I submitted my request two weeks ago and wanted to follow up to confirm its status. Could you please let me know when I might expect the confirmation?

## Explanation of Revisions

Each sentence was rewritten using Kolin’s (2022) principles of the “You Attitude,” which emphasize focusing on the reader’s perspective rather than the writer’s needs. This approach encourages politeness, empathy, and professionalism while maintaining clarity.

For example, accusatory or self-centered phrases such as “Can they ever get things straight?” were replaced with objective and solution-oriented wording like “Could you please review the order details?” This shift aligns with Kolin’s guidance to consider how the message will be received and to frame communication in a way that maintains goodwill.
